# Heroku [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) build

ðŸŒˆ In February 2017, [Next was fixed](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/pull/1164) so that it no longer requires a static build path. As a result, **this build adapter is no longer required**. Next may be deployed to Heroku without any special setup.
