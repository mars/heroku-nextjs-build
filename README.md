# Heroku [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) build

🌈 In February 2017, [Next was fixed](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/pull/1164) so that it no longer requires a static build path. As a result, **this build adapter is no longer required**.

▶️ Head over to the [Next on Heroku](https://github.com/mars/heroku-nextjs) example app.
